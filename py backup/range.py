#for x in range(6):
#    print(x)

#^^ Since x isn't put to anything, it prints all of them from 0 - 5 
    #because it always starts at 0 and 6 characters goes to 5
    #x will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

#------------------------------------------------------------

#for x in range(2, 6):
#    print(x)

#^^ x is in the range of 2 - 6. Which means the second character to the 6th character
    #x will print to be 2, 3, 4, 5

#------------------------------------------------------------

#for x in range(2, 30, 3):
#    print(x)

#^^ the range is between 2 and 30. The third letter is the incriment of looping. 
    #instead of going 1 by 1, it goes 3 by 3 i.e., 2, 5, 8, etc.
